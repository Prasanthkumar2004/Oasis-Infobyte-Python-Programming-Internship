# Oasis-Infobyte-Python-Programming-Internship

The focus of this internship was data science and analytics. On the Oasis Infobyte website, I submitted an application for this internship. I finished every duty they gave me. I have handed them 3 of the 5 assignments they have assigned us. Below is a list of all the assignments I've completed

Project-2: BMI Calculator
Using the provided weight and height parameters, I developed a BMI calculator to classify users into health categories like underweight, normal, and overweight. I utilized a command-line approach for beginners and a GUI-based version for advanced users using Tkinter, incorporating data storage and visualization features.

Project-3: Random Password Generator
I created a random password generator that allows users to generate secure passwords based on customizable length and character preferences. The beginner version is command-line based, while the advanced version features a GUI with clipboard integration and security rule enforcement.

Project-4: Basic Weather App
This weather app fetches current weather data for user-specified locations using a weather API. The beginner version operates via command line, while the advanced version includes a user-friendly GUI with detailed forecasts, GPS integration, and visual weather elements.
